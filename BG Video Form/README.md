# About

- In this I have created a signup form using <strong>HTML</strong> & <strong>CSS</strong>.
- In the background of page I have uses video as background which makes it a bit different from other signup forms.
- You could also see some amazing transitions in the inputs boxes and on the buttons.

Here are some Images of this project after completion...<br>
